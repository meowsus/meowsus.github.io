    <p>I absolutely hate them.</p>

<p>I just got off the phone with a wonderful guy whose part of a wonderful team for which I would be a perfect fit, but did I nail it? I unquestionably and absolutely did not.</p>

<p>There’s always some point in the interview where the darks side of my mind says “Wow, what you just said sounds really stupid” and from that point forward the feeling of failure is unshakable. I nearly intentionally “throw” the interview, deeming it a waste of time for both of us.</p>

<p>This isn’t always the case. Recently I went through four interviews with a company that I didn’t even want to work for. Collecting unemployment means that you have to apply for whatever is available and this was one of those companies who were caught in my widely cast net. Since I went into the interviews with a relatively blase attitude I was able to sidestep the nasty voices in my head and show up authentically. As I met the team I became more attached to the role and found myself eventually fantasizing being their coworker. Of course I didn’t get the job, but this observation has stuck with me.</p>

<p>The conditions under which this experience manifested felt pretty unique. I was laid off in July, apparently the worst time to be laid off in tech, and for my first time ever to boot! Initially many companies expressed interest in me thanks to a nudge from my former CEO in a certain members-only YC message board. That set me out thinking that a job was nearly in my grasp. After that initial round of 15 introductory+ interviews I was offered nearly zero for the remainder of the year.</p>

<p>Besides the aforementioned fluke, each experience has been the same. Invariably throughout the process I hit a point where near total self-sabotage is inevitable. It’s panic response, truly. I say (or, in the case of live coding interviews, <em>do</em>), “the wrong thing” and I panic which causes my brain to completely shut down. And this is a totally novel feeling. I don’t feel this when I’m working. I don’t feel this in my daily life. It’s only seems to manifest when speaking candidly with a complete stranger about how great I am at what they want me to do for them that I experience this panic.</p>

<p>I suppose its because I have too much too lose. My life, livelihood, and my ability to provide for my family hangs in the balance. It’s too much to feel comfortable.</p>

<p>Anyway, to the guy who just interviewed me: I’m sorry that I brought up how I developed a component library when interviewing for a web-architecture position. You asked about my largest project in recent history, and that was the one that popped into my mind first. You then asked a lot of questions about that particular project which, honestly, went off without a hitch, and improved engineering productivity so well that we were able to roll thirteen of our fifteen engineers off the project completely, leaving it in the hands of two engineers.</p>

<p>What I should have talked about was the grueling three weeks of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pnpm</code> migration I just wrapped up, considered an abject failure, and all of the learnings that spurred from that experience. That would have been entirely more apt. Now that I’m not in an interview context I could go on and on about that one ;)</p>
