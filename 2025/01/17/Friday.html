    <p>Welcome to this week’s installment of <em>Find-A-Job-Friday</em>! Each Friday I spend an average of two hours sending resumes and cover letters out to an average of 5 companies, all while telling that little voice in the back of my brain that tries to convince me that it’s just an act of futility to <em>stfu</em>, to use the parlance of digital times past.</p>

<p>Today’s companies included a generalist hire-whatever-engineer-right-now type organization, a “data engine” company with a serious vowel aversion, a company that has screwed me financially not once but twice, and an extremely high-profile music corporation notoriously derided by many musicians (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNLjHBIpQ2g">I’m sorry, Frank</a>). I also applied for a position at Discord but somehow through <a href="https://www.inclusively.com/">Inclusively</a> in ways so confusing I may never know what truly happened. Then there was TurboDebt, which I got excited about (I get very excited to help others), but it was for a “lead” engineer position with no salary posted, so I’m not getting my hopes up.</p>

<p>Quick sidebar: I’d like to work for Sony on the Sound Connect platform. The WF-1000XM4s are the least terrible earbuds I’ve ever owned, though their weight makes my ear canals ache terribly. I’d like to help out on this platform because their mobile application is a hot pile of trash and is a great example of something I can make a lot better. If you work for Sony (or “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guck4FoWQss&amp;t=16s">Sorny</a>,” if you prefer, as I do) <a href="#hit-me-up">hit me up</a>.</p>

<p>I also noticed that Reddit was hiring and reached out to a friend from three jobs ago who works there to see if they wanted a few thousand dollars (I assume) for my referral. I jumped the gun before when applying to that still-unnameable HR software company and probably shorted a former peer out of a fatter-than-normal paycheck. I sometimes forget that this strange cronyism is only rewarded when the corporate steps are climbed in the correct order. But that’s weird, right? Hitting someone up out of the blue and being all “hey, youuu. I know we haven’t spoken in a while. How about you do me a favor and vouch for me.” Ugh, I don’t like it. Necessary evil, I guess.</p>

<p>And, like clockwork, I became exhausted and depressed after my Friday foray into hopeful reemployment. I pushed myself to get some work done. Any work done, really, since this week has been particularly lacking in the focus department.</p>

<p>So, yeah, <strong>I fixed an email template!</strong> Yippee! Such fulfillment!</p>

<p>Actually, this was listed as a bug (again affecting one user on one specific email client), but after seeing their posted screenshots, I had to do something about it. It was also a task I could wrangle in under 2 hours, which is how much time I had left to focus on work after this morning’s corporate prostration.</p>

<p>We had a table, y’see. That table consisted of “album” or “merch” item rows. That table also contained a sub-table of totals. It looked a little sumpin’ like this:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>A</th>
      <th>B</th>
      <th>C</th>
      <th>D</th>
      <th>E</th>
      <th align="right">F</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Image 1</td>
      <td>So much information 1</td>
      <td>Unit Price 1</td>
      <td>Quantity 1</td>
      <td>Any Extra Amount 1</td>
      <td align="right">Row Total 1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Image 2</td>
      <td>So much information 2</td>
      <td>Unit Price 2</td>
      <td>Quantity 2</td>
      <td>Any Extra Amount 2</td>
      <td align="right">Row Total 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Image 3</td>
      <td>So much information 3</td>
      <td>Unit Price 3</td>
      <td>Quantity 3</td>
      <td>Any Extra Amount 3</td>
      <td align="right">Row Total 3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Image 4</td>
      <td>So much information 4</td>
      <td>Unit Price 4</td>
      <td>Quantity 4</td>
      <td>Any Extra Amount 4</td>
      <td align="right">Row Total 4</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="5">Some kinda total 1</td>
      <td align="right">Row Total 1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="5">Some kinda total 2</td>
      <td align="right">Row Total 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="5">Some kinda total 3</td>
      <td align="right">Row Total 3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="5">Some kinda total 4</td>
      <td align="right">Row Total 4</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>

<p>Since this table spanned 6 inflexible columns, when the “so much information” column would grow too large (which it easily could do), we would become subject to the abuse of whatever email client was rendering the message. The complaint came from a user on a laptop. God knows what it looked like on their phone.</p>

<p>The solution I came up with was relatively straightforward. I used two tables, since tabular layout still rules the email layout game, unfortunately. One table displayed the “items” (either “album” or “merch”) and one table displayed the totals. It was kind of like this:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>A</th>
      <th>B</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Image 1</td>
      <td>All other information 1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Image 2</td>
      <td>All other information 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Image 3</td>
      <td>All other information 3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Image 4</td>
      <td>All other information 4</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>A</th>
      <th>B</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Some kinda total 1</td>
      <td>Row Total 1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Some kinda total 2</td>
      <td>Row Total 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Some kinda total 3</td>
      <td>Row Total 3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Some kinda total 4</td>
      <td>Row Total 4</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>These tables are poor representations of the final layout, obviously. The real email templates have purdy pictures and real data. The point I’m making is that most email clients can handle simple table layouts. Tables are never responsive, yet they can be useful for laying out email templates when you must ensure some level of consistency across clients. As a decorated veteran of the browser wars, I can say with full conviction that the battle still rages on in this area of the web.</p>

<p>If you’re reading this and you’re saying to yourself, “if only there were some kind of template that could make <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sombunall">sumbunall</a> of my email woes go away forever,” check out <a href="https://www.cerberusemail.com/">Cerberus</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of this email quick-win, I cleaned up some of my longer-running branches which were never meant to be longer-running in the first place. One of my coworkers was lamenting the number of stalled PRs and the anxiety it made him feel. I, for one, have never felt this type of anxiety, but as I did not want to cause him any undue grief, I consolidated and closed some of my ham-handed attempts at solutions from the week. Nice and tidy now, at least on my end, with one punisher of a PR about to be unleashed which should unblock me for some sick-ass architecture work forthcoming. More on that soon, y’know, when I work on it.</p>

<p>Finally, at the end of my day, I received word that the contract-on-the-spot position <a href="/2025/01/15/Wednesday.html">that I mentioned</a> is becoming an official offer, provided that I agree to a 4.49% decremental adjustment against my stated hourly rate. Seems fine. Like I said, my main goal is to stop the bleed from my savings account, and not having to suffer another interview might be worth the money, all things considered.</p>

<p>I’m responding to him now.</p>
