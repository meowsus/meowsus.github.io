    <p>Long have I fantasized about having AI make my dinner for me. I came close tonight by asking ChatGPT to make a pasta sauce from the ingredients I had laying around the fridge.</p>

<p>To be honest, this isn’t the first time I’ve queried Skynet for the answers to my dinner woes. In fact, when I worked at <a href="https://www.convictional.com/">Convictional</a>, most of the decisions I’d have their platform help me make were about eating, mostly because coming up with actual exemplar business decisions felt too distracting when I was trying to test a code change. Did I mention I don’t work there anymore? I wonder why…</p>

<p>But tonight my fantasy became a small reality when I asked ChatGPT to…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Help me make a sauce to put on my pasta with the stuff I have in my fridge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To which it responded:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sure! Let me know what ingredients you have in your fridge, and I’ll help you make a delicious sauce for your pasta.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So helpful.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Me:</strong> I have olive oil, olives, balsamic vinegar, parmesan cheese, butter, bacon, grilled chicken, nutritional yeast, red wine vinegar, mustard, and a Mexican cheese blend. You don’t need to use them all, but this is what I have to choose from.</p>

  <p><strong>It:</strong> You have a great selection of ingredients! Here’s a simple yet flavorful pasta sauce idea using some of what you have…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it suggested I make a “Garlic, Olive Oil, and Bacon Pasta Sauce.” It sounded good, but a little on the oily side, since it pretty much wanted me to render the fat of 2-4 slices of bacon, mix it with olive oil, and sauté garlic in the grease before tossing the pasta in.</p>

<p>But I was committed. Greasy or not, I would use my great selection of ingredients to make this sauce and feed it to my unsuspecting daughter to get her honest opinion of her father’s authentic Italian cooking skills.</p>

<p>There was just one problem… my bacon was past its expiration date, not by much, but by enough that my thoughts went to the dark recesses of memory where any Philadelphian Domino’s Pizza pepperoni lives. Old pig tastes like old pig, and I wasn’t about to chance blowing my experiment. I wanted to see what it was like to eat digitally generated Italian food and, so help me God, I was committed.</p>

<p>So I told our soon-to-be techno-overlord that the bacon was bad.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Me:</strong> Okay, my bacon is bad. I do have a lot of spices, though. Help me come up with something else. I have milk, too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I kicked myself slightly for throwing the milk curveball at it so late in the game. Sure enough, it seemed to have tainted the result…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>It:</strong> No problem! We can make a creamy, flavorful pasta sauce without the bacon. Here’s an alternative using what you have:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It came up with a “Creamy Garlic Parmesan Sauce” which seemed reasonable. Here were the ingredients:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1-1.5 tablespoons olive oil</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
  <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese</li>
  <li>A pinch of red pepper flakes, optional</li>
  <li>A pinch of oregano and basil</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  <li>A splash of balsamic or red wine vinegar</li>
  <li>Nutritional yeast, optional</li>
</ul>

<p>The instructions were wildly straightforward. I was to sauté the garlic in olive oil for a bit until fragrant, being careful of burning it. This was jarlic, which I neglected to mention to the LLM, so I was more worried about it exploding on contact with the hot oil. I busted out my Trader Joe’s <em>President’s Reserve</em>, kept the heat low, and added the garlic sooner than I usually would. I also mixed in some white truffle olive oil too because I’m a fancy person.</p>

<p>Next, when things seemed garlicky enough, I was to reduce the heat and add the milk. It was supposed to simmer and thicken, a reaction which would have probably been more obvious if the milk had a reasonable amount of fat content. The 2% milk just sort of turned into a pancake in the middle of my garlic oil. However, after about 4 minutes or so I could notice it thickening ever so slightly.</p>

<p>That’s when I added the parmesan (which I can’t help but pronounce <em>par-me-zee-an</em> thanks to that episode of Rick &amp; Morty) with an extra tablespoon of nutritional yeast (pronounced normally) to boot. At this point, things seemed dire. The heat was probably too low to melt definitely expired cheese so I started getting clumpies. I remained confident and undeterred, pouring the splash of balsamic in, which made everything infinitely more clumpy.</p>

<p>I then added in my triple-smoked red pepper flakes, oregano, and basil. I also discovered that I had two unopened jars of oregano and basil that expired in 2022. Those went into the trash, despite my assumption that dried herbs can’t actually go bad.</p>

<p>Now things were looking like stuff. Though clumpy, the mixture was definitely taking on a kind of sauce factor. I tasted it, deemed it fine, and added some pink salt <em>and</em> pepper, mostly because I wanted an excuse to use pink pepper in something.</p>

<p>Okay, we had a sauce now.</p>

<p>The pasta (a brown rice &amp; quinoa abomination, chosen because I fed my children hot dog mac &amp; cheese the night before) was now (over)done and needed to be drained. I did that, saving some pasta water in what I presumed to be a clean cup that this weekend’s houseguests left next to the sink. I threw 2/3 of the cooked pasta in the pan in which I was preparing the sauce and left the other 1/3 in the pot for my baby-paletted seven-year-old son. This pot pasta received half a tablespoon of unsalted butter and some “shakey cheese” (as my mother would call it) on top.</p>

<p>Turning back to my and my daughter’s dinner in the pan, I threw the pasta water in, regretted it instantly, and kicked the heat up to maximum to try to evaporate some of my mistake.</p>

<p>I threw our three meals into as many bowls and vigorously ate mine.</p>

<p>It was greasy, but flavorful. I probably used twice as much olive oil as I should have but who knows because I don’t measure that stuff. I gave it a solid 7/10. Above the line, but not great. My daughter ate about 2/3 of it, told me it was too spicy, and requested a paper cup of instant miso ramen. Touché, kiddo. I guess we’ll have to brave the grocery store tomorrow completely against all of our wills.</p>
