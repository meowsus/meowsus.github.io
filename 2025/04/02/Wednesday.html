    <p>As I sit down to write, I pour myself about 3 ounces of Mijenta Tequlia Blanco to wash the taste of Trader Joe’s Crunchy Chili Onion Peanuts out of my mouth. The flavor combination is an abomination as well as an act of penance for my lack of writing as of late. My apologies, David.</p>

<p>This week I’ve been uninspired. The project I’ve been working on just wrapped up agency work’s infamous Phase One or, in other words, the phase where we work relatively unimpeded until all the site functionality is built out. Phase Two is beginning and the client is realizing just how long it’s going to take them to load all their products in. There’s not much an agency can do during Phase Two except respond to client question and address the occasional bug fix.</p>

<p>During the phase change I had my first glimpse at both the gaping maw of “what the hell am I supposed to work on now?” and the razor sharp teeth littered throughout said maw of “holy fuck, I found something to work on! Why the hell do I need to pay attention to the project I just finished!” I need to be better at avoiding the maw entirely, but those teeth still seem to be littered about the wasteland of contracting. Weird analogy. Sorry about it.</p>

<p>I can avoid the maw entirely by packing my back pockets full of developer experience work but, as I’ve pointed out multiple times already in previous posts, I have trouble prioritizing that stuff in the heat of the moment. Honestly, in the before-fore times, I would take a fucking vacation when a project wound up at a natural, albeit temporary, conclusion. The switch between Phase One and Phase Two of this project was a perfect example. Still, I soldiered on. Why? Well shit, Dave. I’m a contractor with a mortgage, that’s why.</p>

<p>Going back to my original, weird-ass analogy then, is the beast which possesses the maw <em>burn out?</em> Maybe. It’s always stalking me, on the edges of neat little cluttered office/bedroom. One of these days, when I least expect it, it will pounce and devour me whole. But until that day I will remain gleefully ignorant of its advances.</p>

<p>So, yeah, anyway: context switching. I’ve heard it leads to burn out. I think we’ve all heard that, right? I need more tequila. It’s a Wednesday.</p>

<p>At Convictional, empowered to be my own best and true self with zero metrics to hold me accountable, I, and the vast majority of the engineering team, avoided context switching like the plague. We had “deep focus” time which was supposed to be, like, <em>all</em> of the time and it worked really well. We all worked at a slower pace (email only, no Slack) yet still got shit done much more quickly than any of the other teams I’ve worked with before. All engineers hate context switching, I’m pretty sure. <em>Give me focus time, or give me death</em> I’m sure is an adage on a banner on the wall of some nerd’s house somewhere. We want to noodle on the solution to a problem, and we don’t want to be pinged while we’re ding dong doing it.</p>

<p>But I work at an agency. And I’m a contractor. And I’m trying to get hired at said agency. And I’m a people pleaser.</p>

<p>And I need some very specific conditions to present themselves before I embark on a green-fields, do-what-you-feel-is-best, we-trust-you type of project. Maybe some real world examples might help at this point, as I remind myself to be sensitive to the fact that this is a public repository, published to a public domain, where people can relatively easily figure out what company I work for:</p>

<p>I’ve been working on a website which is loaded onto a kiosk through the installation of a progressive web app. It’s a bridge between our client’s customers and their sales team, meaning that they don’t sell anything through the website, despite it being a Shopify instance. What we end up doing is bundling up their cart items and create a draft order which the sales associate can pull up in their Shopify POS app. This is Phase One. It’s rife with “build this chunk of the design”, “build that chunk of the design”, “the client said this isn’t working as expected”, and “I tested this and it’s working as expected but <em>what if it worked a bit more like something that no one expected until now?</em>”</p>

<p>I’m content doing this work. I could do this work for money for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>But Phase One ended and we’re in that weird phase shift period where we’re still having weekly sprint planning meetings but aren’t coming up with anything substantial to tackle. Actually, we’re <em>creating more work</em> that doesn’t need to be worked on, now or possibly ever.</p>

<p>Cut to the solution to the aforementioned maw: I was roped into another project, one that is absolutely and completely theoretical at this point. The problem to solve is “can we use the insanity of Shopify Liquid to build a custom window… customizer?” The answer seems like “yes” at this point, which is cool, but at what cost, I wonder? I am seriously wondering. I haven’t had the time to dig into how we’re approaching the problem up to this point, since the previous project is still rearing it’s adorable head from time to time.</p>

<p>I’ve been tasked with the 2D graphics aspect of the window customizer. I really, truly want to dig into this. It’s a tasty coconut of a problem to crack. However, the stars must align for me to really, truly dig in. I need (a) space from the previous project, (b) nothing to do in the morning but drink coffee and jamb (pun <em>very much intended</em>), and (c) enough time to deep focus, otherwise I languish in a unmotivated state and constantly choose to reach for lower hanging fruit in an attempt to put the previous project to bed.</p>

<p>I guess I bring this up because it’s an unexpected aspect of contracting that I didn’t anticipate before. It’s familiar but slightly different, since there’s a bit more at stake and an expectation that I set on myself to be at maximal performance all of the time. This afternoon looks like an ok time to get some focus in, though. Maybe a second cup of coffee is in order.</p>
