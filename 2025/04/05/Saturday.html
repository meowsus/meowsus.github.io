    <p>I did. I did tell myself I wouldn‚Äôt work this weekend. Then again, if I qualify personal projects as ‚Äúwork‚Äù I‚Äôll probably never get to them.</p>

<p>This project is more of a product, to be honest. It is a goal of mine to diversify my revenue streams (I say while throwing up in my mouth a little bit). As David could tell you, I spent about seven months unexpectedly without income very recently and the experience taught me a few things. Well, one thing, really. The lesson I learned was that I need money to live.</p>

<p>Some Davids may remember that I was laid off two weeks before the closing date on my new house and it was hubris which made me go through with the sale. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hirable,‚Äù I thought. ‚ÄúTwenty six years of finger-waggles-for-cash must mean something, right?‚Äù Seven long, terrifying, and darkly depressing months later the only company that would commit to hiring me was a company comprised of six people I had worked with for years almost a lifetime ago. I‚Äôm very appreciative, of course, but I‚Äôm also a Leo (unfortunately) so naturally my ego has been bruised by the experience, to say the least.</p>

<p>So I said, to myself and my therapist, ‚ÄúI never want to experience this again. I feel like I need to make money from multiple sources in order to better shield myself for the next major life change of this sort.‚Äù She replied, ‚ÄúHow about you start small and just start saving some extra money each month?‚Äù Valid, sure, but why save up a relative mountain of cash, just to watch it all disappear when someone else deems you as disposable? Sure, maybe I have a control thing that I should explore a bit more, but it seems to me that if I can use these wagglin‚Äô fingers to generate, say, my mortgage payment every month, that feels like a reasonable goal which would also allow me to squirrel away some savings at the same time. Right?</p>

<p>My mortgage is uncomfortably expensive. Relative to all the lucky homeowner friends of mine, all of whom refinanced during the pandemic, I look like an idiot. I couldn‚Äôt afford to buy this place when the rates were low. Heck, I couldn‚Äôt comfortably afford a down payment in my area at all without the help of my mother. For someone who has owned four houses in their lifetime I am extremely risk adverse and exceptionally, Scottishly frugal. I‚Äôve worn some of the same clothes for over a decade. My house is relatively barren of kitsch. My gargantuan, immovable California King cost me $300. Even though I get paid nearly a third of a bone surgeon‚Äôs salary, I have no retirement plans barring the death of a previously unknown relative who named me as their sole heir to their vast wealth, on the condition that I spend one night in their clearly haunted mansion perched atop some terrifying, cemetery hillock.</p>

<p>But this all comes down to my first of three problems I‚Äôm trying to solve: I am terrible at setting goals for myself. I can set goals at work, but in my personal life (read: the approximate 27.7% of my life where I‚Äôm not responsible for work throughput or kid care) I can‚Äôt seem to get motivated to progress toward anything substantial. And that makes sense, right? A goal is an end result. To get to the goal, you need to work. To work, you need time to focus. To focus you need to construct the environment in which you are actually able to focus. I can‚Äôt focus on myself when I‚Äôm working. I can‚Äôt focus on myself when my children are around. If this takes up 72.3% of my waking life, how am I supposed to make progress toward anything substantial? I think that the answer is to set more easily obtainable goals, or goals that are accomplishable in the amount of time that you have. Time is the second problem.</p>

<p>The third is a problem of creativity. People tell me that I‚Äôm creative, but I don‚Äôt feel that way. I‚Äôve always seen myself as someone who aides creative people. In my work I aide designers. In my bands I aide the guitarist. I feel that this is where I‚Äôm most useful, in a supporting role. And I like this about myself. I‚Äôve helped a lot of musicians collaborate and produce their art. I‚Äôve made websites for more companies than I could name if you had a gun to my head. But when it comes to personal projects I am unproductive. When given a green-field and a sack of seeds I would rather sit and eat the seeds than try to plan where the hell they should be planted. This is a big problem and one I‚Äôd love to overcome. Let‚Äôs face it: I‚Äôm forty years old. At this point I should be working for myself because, honestly, how many more years do I have before I‚Äôm totally unhirable?</p>

<p>This last problem was actually illuminated rather recently and was the reason I was let go from Convictional. We had pivoted away from a proven product, ripe with things to be done, into a business of the future. We started building software that was far before its time, betting that one day it would be a market. That still remains to be proven, but I immediately found myself struggling. I was asked to ‚Äúremain productive‚Äù but without any kind of definition as to what that meant. I watched my peers develop a boundary-less product and struggled to understand where they were getting their ideas from. The shape of the whole thing was confusing and unfamiliar since, until that time, I had been accustomed to onboarding to a domain while figuring out ways to be effective within said domain. Without any kind of domain whatsoever, the work felt pointless and confusing. My boss told me that I‚Äôd ‚Äúprobably do better at a late-stage startup,‚Äù to which I have all manner of thoughts and feelings about, but to a degree he was right; without a target to support I struggled greatly to be effective. I only realized that he was onto something when I joined Ampwall, the most zero-to-one company I had ever been a part of, and found myself feeling a bit of the same thing all over again. It was difficult to direct my energy because priorities were unclear, the overall direction seemed locked inside someone else‚Äôs head, and I couldn‚Äôt find a cleft in the cliff in which I could cram my crampon.</p>

<p>To recap: I‚Äôm bad at setting, keeping, and progressing personal goals. I‚Äôm bad at cultivating my own ideas. I have virtually no time in which to work, both on these problems or on a project or product which could benefit me financially.</p>

<p>Or, a more therapeutic way to say this would be to replace ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bad at‚Äù with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm unaccustomed, uncomfortable, or unfamiliar with.‚Äù The time can be practically remedied by spending an ungodly amount of money on childcare.</p>

<p>Oh, I also have ADHD. Case in point, this post was supposed to be about the practical application of a pretty interesting solution I stumbled upon for these problems, but now I‚Äôve written for two hours and have to go paint my kid‚Äôs room for the third time. But what a cliffhanger!</p>
