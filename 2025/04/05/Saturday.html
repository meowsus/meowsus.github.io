    <p>I did. I did tell myself I wouldn’t work this weekend. Then again, if I consider personal projects as “work,” I’ll probably never get to them.</p>

<p>This project is more of a product, to be honest. It’s a goal of mine to diversify my revenue streams (I say while feeling slightly nauseated). As David could tell you, I spent about seven months unexpectedly without income, and the experience taught me a few things—well, one thing, really: I need money to live.</p>

<p>Some Davids may remember that I was laid off two weeks before the closing date on my new house, and it was hubris that made me go through with the sale. “I’m hirable,” I thought. “Twenty-six years of finger-waggles-for-cash must mean something, right?” Seven long, terrifying, and darkly depressing months later, the only company that would commit to hiring me was a team of six people I’d worked with years ago. I’m very appreciative, of course, but I’m also a Leo (unfortunately), so naturally, my ego has been bruised by the experience.</p>

<p>So I said to myself and my therapist, “I never want to experience this again. I feel like I need to make money from multiple sources to better shield myself for the next major life change.” She replied, “How about you start small and just save a little extra money each month?” Valid, sure. But why save up a relative mountain of cash, only to watch it all disappear when someone else deems you disposable? Maybe I have a control issue that I should explore, but if I can use these wagglin’ fingers to generate, say, my mortgage payment each month, that seems like a reasonable goal. It would also let me squirrel away some savings at the same time. Right?</p>

<p>My mortgage is uncomfortably expensive. Relative to all my homeowner friends—who refinanced during the pandemic—I look like an idiot. I couldn’t afford to buy this place when the rates were low. Heck, I couldn’t comfortably afford a down payment in my area without the help of my mother. For someone who has owned four houses, I am extremely risk-averse and exceptionally, Scottishly frugal. I’ve worn some of the same clothes for over a decade. My house has almost no kitsch. My gargantuan, immovable California King cost me $300. Even though I get paid nearly a third of a bone surgeon’s salary, I have no retirement plan apart from hoping a distant relative might name me their sole heir, on the condition that I spend a night in a clearly haunted mansion perched atop some cemetery hillock.</p>

<p>This leads me to the first of three problems I’m trying to solve: I am terrible at setting goals for myself. I can set goals at work, but in my personal life (the approximate 27.7% of my time when I’m not on the clock or tending kids), I can’t seem to get motivated. It makes sense, right? A goal is an end result. To get there, you need to work; to work, you need time to focus; to focus, you need an environment where you actually can. I can’t focus on myself when I’m working or watching my children. That takes up 72.3% of my waking hours. So how am I supposed to make progress? Maybe the answer is to set smaller, more achievable goals. Time is the second problem.</p>

<p>The third is creativity. People say I’m creative, but I don’t feel that way. I’ve always seen myself as someone who aids creative people. In my job, I support designers. In my bands, I support the guitarist. I like this about myself, but I’ve helped countless musicians collaborate and built websites for more companies than I could name if you threatened me. When it comes to personal projects, though, I do nothing. Given a green field and a sack of seeds, I’d rather just eat the seeds than figure out where to plant them. Let’s face it: I’m forty. By now, I should be working for myself, because how many more years do I have before I’m unhirable?</p>

<p>This last issue became clear when I was let go from Convictional. We had pivoted away from a proven product—ripe with tasks—into some futuristic concept. We were building software far ahead of its time and betting there would one day be a market. That still needs to be proven. I was asked to “remain productive” without any real definition of what that meant. I watched my peers develop a boundary-less product and struggled to understand where they got their ideas. Until then, I’d always on-boarded to a domain and found ways to be effective. Without any domain at all, the work felt pointless. My boss said I’d “probably do better at a late-stage startup,” which gave me all sorts of feelings, but he was right: without a target to support, I struggled. I realized this again when I joined Ampwall, a truly zero-to-one company, and found myself facing the same issues. It felt impossible to direct my energy when priorities were unclear and the overall direction lived in someone else’s head. I couldn’t find a cleft in the cliff to wedge my crampon into.</p>

<p>To recap: I’m unaccustomed, uncomfortable, and unfamiliar with setting and achieving personal goals. I’m not practiced at cultivating my own ideas, and I have nearly no time to work on these problems or on a project that might help me financially.</p>

<p>Or, to put it more therapeutically, I’m simply unaccustomed, uncomfortable, or unfamiliar with these tasks. And I could theoretically solve the time issue by spending an ungodly amount of money on childcare.</p>

<p>Oh, I also have ADHD. Case in point: this post was supposed to be about the practical application of a pretty interesting solution I stumbled upon for these problems, but now I’ve spent two hours writing and have to go paint my kid’s room for the third time. What a cliffhanger!</p>
