    <p>David, hello.</p>

<p>I’m so happy to hear that your wedding to my cousin went well. I’m assuming it did, based on the pictures I received from you both. I can’t be 100% sure that it went well, as I wasn’t invited. I’m not angry about it. Your explanation that my invitation would force your hand to invite <em>the other</em> cousins made complete sense to me. Therefore, I willfully and ignorantly choose to believe that your wedding went off without a hitch, and that you and the only cousin I still maintain semi-regular contact with are well on your way to your happily ever after.</p>

<p>I am writing to you today to inform you that this will be my last day of work at my company.</p>

<p>Abruptly leaving a contract position feels so very wrong. Historically speaking, I have given far more than two weeks’ worth of notice when I change jobs. In this case, I received an offer two days into the last week of my contract cycle and, since I won’t have the bandwidth to juggle both jobs, I needed to announce that I’d wrap up the thing I’ve been working on and hand it to my “manager” on Friday. I announced this to my “boss” yesterday. He expressed deep, deep professional regret that they “weren’t able to keep me around,” blatantly ignoring the fact that I, and many of my coworkers, advocated for a full-time position for me multiple times. He asked me to stop what I was already invested in working on that week, pivot my remaining time to a brand new project they signed while I was out last week, and knock out as much as I could by Friday.</p>

<p>I was a bit dismayed. I had been working on a truly wild UI that our designer chose to torture us with for the new marketing website for the company. When switching onto this internal project weeks ago, I asked my “manager” (let’s call him Chugs, for the sake of anonymity), “What is the part of this project that you absolutely don’t want anything to do with?” And that’s how I came away with this hunk of work. Anyway, I was bashing my head into this eldritch, parallaxian monstrosity of a UI for about a week before the offer came in. Ditching and switching context now felt wrong for me, but probably right for the company—but for a company I won’t work for in three days. What possible deliverable can I produce in three days from a twenty-seven-minute phone call with a client, casually linked to me without context? Oh, did I say three days? Jesus, where is my head today? My kids don’t have school Thursday or Friday this week. Can I get anything meaningful accomplished in one day, then? No. Unlikely.</p>

<p>I decided to save them the money. I’m not working the rest of the week. I’ll join the oft-under-attended Friday social get-together to say goodbye to whomever decides to show up, and then I’m off to bigger and better things.</p>

<p>Well, not right away… I’m not starting until November 17th. I figure I could use a break, as I’ve worked every weekday since February without a meaningful break whatsoever. Last week I announced I’d be taking a vacation, citing “burnout” as the reason, to Chugs. The reason was true, but the vacation was not; I worked a vibe-check week for the new company. Coming back on Monday was pretty difficult because, guess what? I’m still profoundly burnt out.</p>

<p>So hey, hi, I’m unemployed until mid-November.</p>

<p>What will I do? <em>What to do… what to do…</em> Frankly, I’m not sure. I have that cookbook app which is finally taking shape, but that’s technically work so I should avoid it. I have been meaning to get back into my spooky, occult meditation—or any meditation practice, really. I’ve spent the last two months doing Pilates every morning, but the vibe-check week put a stop to that, since my new working hours will be 9 AM to 5 PM EST. I’m still driven. That’ll come back. Man, being able to stand up straight for the first time in my adult life? Shit is wild. Why didn’t anyone tell me about this before? Besides that, I’m sure I’ll OD on movies and pinball. Definitely a lot of journaling. Maybe this blog will get an update or two along the way.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m happy for you—and it is Wednesday—my dude. Don’t have kids!</p>
