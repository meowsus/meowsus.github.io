    <p class="mb-4">
      TL;DR - I have over 20 years of experience, mostly in e-commerce. I have
      worked for every size of company, from 20 person startups to mega
      corporations. For the last decade I've been focused on e-commerce product
      development. Most recently, I've enjoyed helping teams level up through
      sane architecture and director mentorship.

    When I was six years old, my father bought a Mac SE. He gave me the great
    honor of pressing the power button first and from the moment I watched the
    watched the introductory Hypercard demo I was building weird little stacks
    for my Dad and leaving them on his desktop for him to find later.

  <p class="mb-4">
    Flash forward eight years, one day after school at a friend's house, my life
    changed forever. I into his Dad's office, expecting to play Descent, but
    instead found my friend furiously typing in Notepad. He would clickity-klack
    for a while and then tab over to Internet Explorer and refresh the browser.
    I asked what he was doing, but he shushed me, so I just sat and watched him
    build what was what turned out to be a website. For the next three months I
    learned enough HTML through osmosis and HtmlGoodies.com to build my own
    website.
