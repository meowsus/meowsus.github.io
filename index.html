      <main class=""><p class="text-lg text-slate-600 mb-8">My intent with this blog is to catalog my daily work. I will try to dedicate the final 30 minutes of my day to this writing. I do this both for reflection and to free myself from any and all brainworms which may have attached themselves to me throughout the day.

    - I got a late start today despite getting the kids to school on time. On a good drop-off day, I get back to my house around 8:30 in the morning, which leaves me a scant 30 minutes to journal, stretch, and meditate.

    - After a rocky morning with my newly christened tweenager, full of fights surrounding their ability to choose and apply clothing to their own damn bodies their own damn selves, I was finally out the door and off to their school only about 20 minutes after the bell rang. Every day is a gift.
