      &nbsp;It’s Friyay and I just worked my first honest-to-God 40-hour work week in probably three years.

      &nbsp;Sorry for the break, David, but I did end up going a little crazy. I followed the whole self-scripting thing a bit too deeply, got frustrated, and took a two-week mental break. Well, kind of. I still made some pretty good progress on Journai. Now I can write posts and have Tarot readings assigned to them. That’s progress. I haven’t been active with Ampwall since signing that month-to-month contract offer. I’ve been focusing on myself.

      &nbsp;Ok, hi. I told myself I wouldn’t work this week after having the revelation that I am often guilty of rolling off one project and immediately onto another. I wanted to change that behavior and give myself a break for two weeks to try and process the experience of being unemployed for half a year while also trying to visualize and prepare for the path ahead.

      &nbsp;In lieu of journaling this morning, I wanted to write this post because my brain was all fired up after a series of information streams from yesterday connected in an interesting way for me this morning while I was staring at my dishes.

      &nbsp;Long have I fantasized about having AI make my dinner for me. I came close tonight by asking ChatGPT to make a pasta sauce from the ingredients I had laying around the fridge.

      &nbsp;Welcome to this week’s installment of Find-A-Job-Friday! Each Friday I spend an average of two hours sending resumes and cover letters out to an average of 5 companies, all while telling that little voice in the back of my brain that tries to convince me that it’s just an act of futility to stfu, to use the parlance of digital times past.

      &nbsp;I took the day off to clean today since I have some friends from Philadelphia staying with me over the weekend. I observed that my normal omg I have to speed up my self-care routine feelings went totally out the window, and I was able to enjoy my journaling and exercise. I wrote a lot, actually.

      &nbsp;I got a late start today despite getting the kids to school on time. On a good drop-off day, I get back to my house around 8:30 in the morning, which leaves me a scant 30 minutes to journal, stretch, and meditate.

      &nbsp;After a rocky morning with my newly christened tweenager, full of fights surrounding their ability to choose and apply clothing to their own damn bodies their own damn selves, I was finally out the door and off to their school only about 20 minutes after the bell rang. Every day is a gift.
