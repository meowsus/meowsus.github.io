      &nbsp;I took the day off to clean today since I have some friends from Philadelphia staying with me over the weekend. I observed that my normal omg I have to speed up my self-care routine feelings went totally out the window, and I was able to enjoy my journaling and exercise. I wrote a lot, actually.

      &nbsp;I got a late start today despite getting the kids to school on time. On a good drop-off day, I get back to my house around 8:30 in the morning, which leaves me a scant 30 minutes to journal, stretch, and meditate.

      &nbsp;After a rocky morning with my newly christened tweenager, full of fights surrounding their ability to choose and apply clothing to their own damn bodies their own damn selves, I was finally out the door and off to their school only about 20 minutes after the bell rang. Every day is a gift.
