        &lt;p&gt;I did. I did tell myself I wouldn‚Äôt work this weekend. Then again, if I consider personal projects as ‚Äúwork,‚Äù I‚Äôll probably never get to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is more of a product, to be honest. It‚Äôs a goal of mine to diversify my revenue streams (I say while feeling slightly nauseated). As David could tell you, I spent about seven months unexpectedly without income, a...

        &lt;p&gt;As I sit down to write, I pour myself about 3 ounces of Mijenta Tequila Blanco to wash the taste of Trader Joe‚Äôs Crunchy Chili Onion Peanuts out of my mouth. The flavor combination is an abomination as well as an act of penance for my lack of writing as of late. My apologies, David.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I‚Äôve been uninspired. The project I‚Äôve been working on just wrapped up age...

        &lt;p&gt;As I‚Äôve already mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;/2025/02/28/Friday.html&quot;&gt;I‚Äôm skittish about being non-billable&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, here I am again, being paid to learn a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm working on kiosk software, a niche my company seems eager to explore. I‚Äôm only about 7 weeks into working here but I think I‚Äôm settling in nicely. I‚Äôm able to apply a lot of the &lt;a href...

        &lt;p&gt;Admittedly my attitude toward being a contractor is a bit skewed. The guilt that I feel when I find myself reaching for my staff engineer hat is really unfounded. This has been reinforced many times over while speaking to my manager and his manager along with the other members of my team. I‚Äôm seen as a full time employee; the contract thing is just a formality. After being unemployed l...

        &lt;p&gt;I touched a bit on this on &lt;a href=&quot;/2025/02/07/Friday.html&quot;&gt;the 7th&lt;/a&gt; but it was back in the forefront of my mind after a six-day work week. I did this to make sure I had 40 hours on my time sheet. One of the conditions for me accepting my current contract was that they were able to give me 40 hours of things to do per week. Would I die if I worked less? No. Ha...

        &lt;p&gt;After spending the last hour rejiggering the intent of this blog and adding an ASCII cat‚Äìfor literally no reason‚ÄìI think I‚Äôm ready to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;/2025/02/11/Tuesday.html&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; I hinted that there was a point to all my rambling. That point was that I‚Äôm busy. I‚Äôm a single dad. I have two kids. I own a home. I usually have a f...

        &lt;p&gt;Now that I fill my days with billable hours, I am becoming acutely aware of just how much time I wasted over the last six months. Moreover, I‚Äôm becoming acutely aware that &lt;em&gt;I work all the time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take yesterday, for example. It was one of those Mondays when I didn‚Äôt have the kids in the morning. On these types of Mondays, I‚Äôve told myself it‚Äôs best...

        &lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs Friyay and I just worked my first honest-to-God 40-hour work week in probably three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not saying that I‚Äôm one of those suspected corporate scofflaws who jag their days away while collecting maximal pay; the kind Silicon Valley is currently trying to drag back to the office five days a week to see if they need to be fired or not. I‚Äôm saying that, when s...

        &lt;p&gt;Sorry for the break, David, but I did end up going &lt;a href=&quot;/2025/01/25/Saturday.html&quot;&gt;a little crazy&lt;/a&gt;. I followed the whole self-scripting thing a bit too deeply, got frustrated, and took a two-week mental break. Well, kind of. I still made some pretty good progress on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/meowsus/journai&quot;&gt;Journai&lt;/a&gt;. Now I can wr...

        &lt;p&gt;Ok, hi. I told myself I wouldn‚Äôt work this week after having the revelation that I am often guilty of rolling off one project and immediately onto another. I wanted to change that behavior and give myself a break for two weeks to try and process the experience of being unemployed for half a year while also trying to visualize and prepare for the path ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I‚Äôve ...

        &lt;p&gt;In lieu of journaling this morning, I wanted to write this post because my brain was all fired up after a series of information streams from yesterday connected in an interesting way for me this morning while I was staring at my dishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday would have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch&quot;&gt;David Lynch&lt;/a&gt;‚Äôs 79th birthday...

        &lt;p&gt;Long have I fantasized about having AI make my dinner for me. I came close tonight by asking ChatGPT to make a pasta sauce from the ingredients I had laying around the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve queried Skynet for the answers to my dinner woes. In fact, when I worked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.convictional.com/&quot;&gt;Convictional&lt...

        &lt;p&gt;Welcome to this week‚Äôs installment of &lt;em&gt;Find-A-Job-Friday&lt;/em&gt;! Each Friday I spend an average of two hours sending resumes and cover letters out to an average of 5 companies, all while telling that little voice in the back of my brain that tries to convince me that it‚Äôs just an act of futility to &lt;em&gt;stfu&lt;/em&gt;, to use the parlance of digital times past.&lt;/p...

        &lt;p&gt;I took the day off to clean today since I have some friends from Philadelphia staying with me over the weekend. I observed that my normal &lt;em&gt;omg I have to speed up my self-care routine&lt;/em&gt; feelings went totally out the window, and I was able to enjoy my journaling and exercise. I wrote a lot, actually.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I got a late start today despite getting the kids to school on time. On a good drop-off day, I get back to my house around 8:30 in the morning, which leaves me a scant 30 minutes to journal, stretch, and meditate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, while journaling, I made an interesting observation: working for Ampwall is a distraction. When I was brought into the fold, it was at a time when ...

        &lt;p&gt;After a rocky morning with my newly christened tweenager, full of fights surrounding their ability to choose and apply clothing to their own damn bodies their own damn selves, I was finally out the door and off to their school only about 20 minutes after the bell rang. Every day is a gift.&lt;/p&gt;
