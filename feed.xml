    <description>My intent with this blog is to catalog my daily work. I will try to dedicate the final 30 minutes of my day to this writing. I do this both for reflection and to free myself from any and all brainworms which may have attached themselves to me throughout the day.

        &lt;p&gt;It’s Friyay and I just worked my first honest-to-God 40-hour work week in probably three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying that I’m one of those suspected corporate scofflaws who jag their days away while collecting maximal pay; the kind Silicon Valley is currently trying to drag back to the office five days a week to see if they need to be fired or not. I’m saying that, when s...

        &lt;p&gt;Sorry for the break, David, but I did end up going &lt;a href=&quot;/2025/01/25/Saturday.html&quot;&gt;a little crazy&lt;/a&gt;. I followed the whole self-scripting thing a bit too deeply, got frustrated, and took a two-week mental break. Well, kind of. I still made some pretty good progress on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/meowsus/journai&quot;&gt;Journai&lt;/a&gt;. Now I can wr...

        &lt;p&gt;Ok, hi. I told myself I wouldn’t work this week after having the revelation that I am often guilty of rolling off one project and immediately onto another. I wanted to change that behavior and give myself a break for two weeks to try and process the experience of being unemployed for half a year while also trying to visualize and prepare for the path ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve ...

        &lt;p&gt;In lieu of journaling this morning, I wanted to write this post because my brain was all fired up after a series of information streams from yesterday connected in an interesting way for me this morning while I was staring at my dishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday would have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch&quot;&gt;David Lynch&lt;/a&gt;’s 79th birthday...

        &lt;p&gt;Long have I fantasized about having AI make my dinner for me. I came close tonight by asking ChatGPT to make a pasta sauce from the ingredients I had laying around the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, this isn’t the first time I’ve queried Skynet for the answers to my dinner woes. In fact, when I worked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.convictional.com/&quot;&gt;Convictional&lt...

        &lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s the weekend. No, I’m not really working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; last night and saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://reedybear.bearblog.dev/ive-been-advocating-for-rss-support-and-you-should-too/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; advocating for more RSS feeds across the web.

        &lt;p&gt;Welcome to this week’s installment of &lt;em&gt;Find-A-Job-Friday&lt;/em&gt;! Each Friday I spend an average of two hours sending resumes and cover letters out to an average of 5 companies, all while telling that little voice in the back of my brain that tries to convince me that it’s just an act of futility to &lt;em&gt;stfu&lt;/em&gt;, to use the parlance of digital times past.&lt;/p...

        &lt;p&gt;I took the day off to clean today since I have some friends from Philadelphia staying with me over the weekend. I observed that my normal &lt;em&gt;omg I have to speed up my self-care routine&lt;/em&gt; feelings went totally out the window, and I was able to enjoy my journaling and exercise. I wrote a lot, actually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My morning journaling routine was really the impet...

        &lt;p&gt;I got a late start today despite getting the kids to school on time. On a good drop-off day, I get back to my house around 8:30 in the morning, which leaves me a scant 30 minutes to journal, stretch, and meditate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, while journaling, I made an interesting observation: working for Ampwall is a distraction. When I was brought into the fold, it was at a time when ...

        &lt;p&gt;After a rocky morning with my newly christened tweenager, full of fights surrounding their ability to choose and apply clothing to their own damn bodies their own damn selves, I was finally out the door and off to their school only about 20 minutes after the bell rang. Every day is a gift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I arrived home I had mere moments before my 9AM interview to refresh mys...
