Boy, does this blog look like crap or what? Honestly, though, I'm just happy that it's up and running.

I wanted to create this "blog" to track my thoughts and experiences while developing. I frequently journal and often need a place to write things down. Hopefully I can keep up with it over time, and hopefully I will make this look a bit better, but for now it should suffice.

So here it is! Another damn [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) install!

It's been a minute since I've used Jekyll. I've been focusing on Next.js for a while now and going back into the Rails-like world is a bit depressing. It feels clunky whereas once it felt elegant. I guess the times, as they say, are a'changin'.
