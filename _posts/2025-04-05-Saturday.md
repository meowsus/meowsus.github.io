I did. I did tell myself I wouldn’t work this weekend. Then again, if I consider personal projects as “work,” I’ll probably never get to them.

This project is more of a product, to be honest. It’s a goal of mine to diversify my revenue streams (I say while feeling slightly nauseated). As David could tell you, I spent about seven months unexpectedly without income, and the experience taught me a few things—well, one thing, really: I need money to live.

Some Davids may remember that I was laid off two weeks before the closing date on my new house, and it was hubris that made me go through with the sale. “I’m hirable,” I thought. “Twenty-six years of finger-waggles-for-cash must mean something, right?” Seven long, terrifying, and darkly depressing months later, the only company that would commit to hiring me was a team of six people I’d worked with years ago. I’m very appreciative, of course, but I’m also a Leo (unfortunately), so naturally, my ego has been bruised by the experience.

So I said to myself and my therapist, “I never want to experience this again. I feel like I need to make money from multiple sources to better shield myself for the next major life change.” She replied, “How about you start small and just save a little extra money each month?” Valid, sure. But why save up a relative mountain of cash, only to watch it all disappear when someone else deems you disposable? Maybe I have a control issue that I should explore, but if I can use these wagglin’ fingers to generate, say, my mortgage payment each month, that seems like a reasonable goal. It would also let me squirrel away some savings at the same time. Right?

My mortgage is uncomfortably expensive. Relative to all my homeowner friends—who refinanced during the pandemic—I look like an idiot. I couldn’t afford to buy this place when the rates were low. Heck, I couldn’t comfortably afford a down payment in my area without the help of my mother. For someone who has owned four houses, I am extremely risk-averse and exceptionally, Scottishly frugal. I’ve worn some of the same clothes for over a decade. My house has almost no kitsch. My gargantuan, immovable California King cost me $300. Even though I get paid nearly a third of a bone surgeon’s salary, I have no retirement plan apart from hoping a distant relative might name me their sole heir, on the condition that I spend a night in a clearly haunted mansion perched atop some cemetery hillock.

This leads me to the first of three problems I’m trying to solve: I am terrible at setting goals for myself. I can set goals at work, but in my personal life (the approximate 27.7% of my time when I’m not on the clock or tending kids), I can’t seem to get motivated. It makes sense, right? A goal is an end result. To get there, you need to work; to work, you need time to focus; to focus, you need an environment where you actually can. I can’t focus on myself when I’m working or watching my children. That takes up 72.3% of my waking hours. So how am I supposed to make progress? Maybe the answer is to set smaller, more achievable goals. Time is the second problem.

The third is creativity. People say I’m creative, but I don’t feel that way. I’ve always seen myself as someone who aids creative people. In my job, I support designers. In my bands, I support the guitarist. I like this about myself, but I’ve helped countless musicians collaborate and built websites for more companies than I could name if you threatened me. When it comes to personal projects, though, I do nothing. Given a green field and a sack of seeds, I’d rather just eat the seeds than figure out where to plant them. Let’s face it: I’m forty. By now, I should be working for myself, because how many more years do I have before I’m unhirable?

This last issue became clear when I was let go from Convictional. We had pivoted away from a proven product—ripe with tasks—into some futuristic concept. We were building software far ahead of its time and betting there would one day be a market. That still needs to be proven. I was asked to “remain productive” without any real definition of what that meant. I watched my peers develop a boundary-less product and struggled to understand where they got their ideas. Until then, I’d always on-boarded to a domain and found ways to be effective. Without any domain at all, the work felt pointless. My boss said I’d “probably do better at a late-stage startup,” which gave me all sorts of feelings, but he was right: without a target to support, I struggled. I realized this again when I joined Ampwall, a truly zero-to-one company, and found myself facing the same issues. It felt impossible to direct my energy when priorities were unclear and the overall direction lived in someone else’s head. I couldn’t find a cleft in the cliff to wedge my crampon into.

To recap: I’m unaccustomed, uncomfortable, and unfamiliar with setting and achieving personal goals. I’m not practiced at cultivating my own ideas, and I have nearly no time to work on these problems or on a project that might help me financially.

Or, to put it more therapeutically, I’m simply unaccustomed, uncomfortable, or unfamiliar with these tasks. And I could theoretically solve the time issue by spending an ungodly amount of money on childcare.

Oh, I also have ADHD. Case in point: this post was supposed to be about the practical application of a pretty interesting solution I stumbled upon for these problems, but now I’ve spent two hours writing and have to go paint my kid’s room for the third time. What a cliffhanger!
