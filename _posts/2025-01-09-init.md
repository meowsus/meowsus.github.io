Boy, does this blog look like crap or what? Honestly, though, I'm just happy that it's up and running.

I wanted to create this "blog" to track my thoughts and experiences while developing. I frequently journal and often need a place to write things down. Hopefully I can keep up with it over time, and hopefully I will make this look a bit better, but for now it should suffice.
