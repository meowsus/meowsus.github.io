title: Will Code For Food - A Curt Howard Story
---

I began my professional career in 2003, slangin' HTML for Big Pharma. My mother worked at Merck, see, and she got me the interview after finding a job posting in their internal circular that was left on the floor of the bathroom at her office. The guy who interviewed me reminded me of Joe Pesci &mdash; like, <em>a lot</em> &mdash; but something in the chubby punk kid who sat before him made him say, "let's do this."

And "did this" we did! I worked for Merck for a few years before being poached by Johnson &amp; Johnson (a common practice and indicative of their stout rivalry) before winding up <em>back</em> at Merck, wondering if this corporate game of Pong was what I actually wanted.

Spoiler alert: It wasn't.

Around 2006 I moved from the suburbs into the heart of North Philadelphia and began working at what turned out to be little more than an e-commerce sweatshop in Old City. Don't get me wrong, the experience is exactly what I needed, but the environment was far beyond acceptable toxicity levels for sustainable life. That place helped me realize that (a) everyone wants to sell stuff to everyone and (b) they need to start selling everything to everyone as soon as possible. I must have launched over 200 websites in 4 years that I worked there.

By 2010 I had had enough of working in a windowless basement so I teamed up with a close friend of mine who was looking for a partner at his then one-man design firm. Together, we mostly launched WooCommerce stores for people but I would take on a few extra projects now and then, not the least of which was <em>single-handedly maintaining the entirety of the bonus payout system for an international beer distributor who shall remain unnamed for fear of repercussions stemming from an NDA which is likely way past the statute of limitations at this point.</em>

Then, in 2013, my wife began gestating our first child. Until that point I had, erm, "enjoyed" a life of hustle that afforded me all of the luxuries of someone managing to rake an income just barely over the poverty line. Shucks. It was time to get a "big boy" job.

But would I get a big boy job? Hell no. I decided to start working for startups. My criteria for employment was virtually <code class="bg-slate-300">if (job.hasHealthcare) employmentPaperwork.sign()</code>. I followed that beer distributors project to a small but established design shop back in Old City, and felt great about the move until <em>literally everyone but one engineer quit</em> about a month later. Shucks again, but for real this time.

Lucky for me, my project manager landed directly across the street at a company called Workarea (nee Weblinc) and drug me along with her. I had gone full circle, it seemed. Though it was no sweatshop, I was back to building e-commerce sites but now for some pretty high-profile customers. The work wasn't terribly rewarding, however. I mean, I had already copypasta'd site after site after site for customers, so I started cuddling up to my mentor who was selected to become half of the team that was selected to build a marketable platform out of our most-copied pasta.

Before I knew it I found myself replacing my mentor as the Frontend Lead (weird title) for the platform and, eventually, the entire company. While in this position I honed a lot of skills, not the least of which was working closely with our implementers to hear their pain and respond appropriately from our platform's perspective. My ultimate job was to only write code that would benefit our small-but-growing community, and to make that code as easy to understand and extend without having to write a ton of documentation. We were a small team, after all, and had only 5 engineers at our peak. Our code had to be clean, organized, sane, and self-documenting in order to appeal to our intended audience: other engineers.

I worked for Workarea for the next 6 years, through their move to become an open-source competitor for Shopify, and only left after I moved to the West Coast (Portland, obviously). As it turns out <code class="bg-slate-300">eastCoast.money !== westCoast.money</code> and I found myself struggling to pay the bills for my now four-member family.

Enter my stint with Silicon Valley, stage left: I spent two years (and a pandemic) with Tophatter, a now-defunct online dollar-auction app. Man, did people love that thing while they were sitting in their midwestern homes during lock-down. Ethically, Tophatter made me feel pretty nasty, but I truly loved the team and was able to learn the ins and outs of mobile development at scale. But Tophatter ended up struggling alongside the supply chain. Most of the products we sold were coming from China, of course, so naturally the Americans used to increasingly rapid ship times were getting restless. They ended up shuttering the doors just around two years after I started.

Luckily, a few weeks before the shutdown, I was pinged by "my better half" from the product team at Workarea. He said he started at this wild place called Convictional and that the job was a utopia. I was skeptical, because he was saying all types of things about "high EQ at work", "zero toxicity", "a focus on deep work", etc, etc. "Impossible," I said, "but I'll talk to your manager." After that conversation, I was sold. It turned out to be completely true. All of it. I was hired to do what I was born (at Workarea) to do, but in a more intimate setting; wrangle the frontend for a dropshipping app, then make it predicable and enjoyable to use for the <em>harshest</em> of audiences: Golang engineers.

I often joke that "it's my job to write myself out of my job," and that's what I essentially did at Convictional. The company ended up pivoting to an "Oops: All AI" newly fundamental startup, and that ultimately didn't really appeal to me.

So now I'm out here in the breeze (literally; I'm writing this from my front porch) and I'm on the hunt again!
